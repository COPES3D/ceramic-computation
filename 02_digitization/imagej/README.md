## Instructions for using ImageJ with Profile Drawings

The goal of using ImageJ is to create mathematical outlines of the ceramic profiles.  We will start with rim profiles.  Rim profiles show what the ceramic looks like when cut into a section.  For our purposes, we only want to use the right hand side of the profile:

This gives us a picture of what half of the ceramic looked like.  In most cases, the rim is broken at the bottom, in which case, we want to end up with a mathematical outline that is open at the broken end.  If the ceramic is complete, we will want a closed outline of half the vessel.
